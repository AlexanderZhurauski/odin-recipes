        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>12 ounces filet mignon, about 1 1/2 inches thick</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried marjoram</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
            <li>In a covered microwave-safe bowl, heat the olive oil and garlic in the microwave for 50 to 60 seconds. Remove and allow to cool.</li>
            <li>Add the rosemary, thyme, and marjoram, and stir. Let sit for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place the filet mignon into a shallow glass dish.</li>
            <li>Pour the herb mixture over the steaks, turning them over to coat evenly. Cover and let marinate for 2 to 4 hours in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li>Preheat the grill for high heat. Right before placing steaks on the grill, oil the grate with a long pair of tongs,
                 folded paper towels, and oil. Make 3 to 4 passes on the grate.</li>
            <li>Remove the steaks from the fridge, and season both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Place the steaks on the grill and cook for 5 to 6 minutes per side, or to the desired doneness.</li>
            <li>Remove steaks from the heat and let rest for at least 5 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
